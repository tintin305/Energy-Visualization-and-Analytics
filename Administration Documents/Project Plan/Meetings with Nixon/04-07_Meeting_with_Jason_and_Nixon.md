# Obtaining Data
* Down the line goal: set up VPN tunnel
* Decouple data and the rest of the program
* Currently: SQL database off campus
* Initially 'hacky' solution is fine

# Licences
* Mention in our plan
* Attribute code as you go
* If need a quick solution, can sort out licences later
* Not planning on making money, Wits property
* If get stuck, can ask

# General:
 **PICK A FOCUS**
 * Think about what people want to see, operators of the university all the way down to engineers and ISTPassword
 * option: focus on good platform to enable others to analyse data
 * What do we need to get right to answer the important questions
    * What are the important questions
* New tariff? - time of use tariff
    * standard, off-peak and peak times 
* Enable people to play with the data themselves
    * python is good at handling large data sets, look at other options
* Linking energy usage and environmental factors

 * Important to:
    * Demonstrate the concept
    * Communication of decisions
    * Not underestimate data handling side of the project
* Choose methodology to use for testing
* Use aspects of agile and scrum

* Plan is not final
    * Show ability to think through the requirements of the project
    * Motivate why you plan on doing things

* Milestones
    * Consider when and what to show people 
    * Plan for meetings with interested stake-holders and time to implement their suggestions
    * Go to meetings with something to show
        * Prototype, skeleton set-up

* Look at:
    * Power BI
    * Options for handling large data sets
        * Python


* People to talk to:
    * Milka from Dlab -> Bis (has loads of data)
    * Fana? - later
    * Nixon and Jason will organise things
