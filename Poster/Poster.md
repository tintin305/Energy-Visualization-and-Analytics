## OpenTSDB

Time series database (TSDB) is inherently useful for this type of data as it makes use of key-value pairs. These key value pairs are made up of a timestamp and a corresponding, associated value, which in this case represents energy usage for a specific time period.
The database has a convenient set of utilities that allow for importing, managing, and querying any data required. OpenTSDB is made up of a Time Series Daemon (TSD) which allow for users to interact with the underlying data. The underlying data is stored using HBASE or Google Bigtable.
Interaction with the data is done using number of supported methods: a telnet-style protocol, an HTTP API, or the built in user interface.
